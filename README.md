# Cosmetic stores management
## About
This is an SQL project I created for managing an imaginary chain of cosmetic stores.
 
This database contains information about the cosmetic stores within this chain, the cities where these stores are located, the managers who run them, the products sold, the employees working in these stores, the suppliers products are ordered from for stock maintenance, the orders with their details, placed to suppliers, the customers who purchase products from these stores and the sales done in these stores. The purpose of creating this database is to keep the evidence of inventory, orders to suppliers, employees and their distribution in various stores and sales realized in these stores, with products purchased by various customers.

## What I learned:
* creating tables regarding to independent and associative entities and adding constraints to them
* designing an E/R diagram
* designing a conceptual diagram
* normalizing up to the 3rd normal form
* using different functions, both single-row and multiple-row functions
* using various operations
* working with LMD and LDD commands
* using clauses, like: HAVING, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
