# Data Base Project

This is an SQL project I created for managing an imaginary chain of cosmetic stores.
 
The project contains four documents:
* "133_Coman_IrinaElena-proiect" includes the whole original project
* "133_Coman_IrinaElena-Database_Project" includes the english version of the project
* "133_Coman_IrinaElena-creare_inserare" covers requirements 10-11 from the project
* "133_Coman_IrinaElena-exemple" contains requirements 12-15 from the project.

What I learned:
* the use of different functions, both single-row and multiple-row functions
* the use of various operations
* the implementation of subqueries, tables
* working with commands like: UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP etc.
* the use of clauses, like: HAVING, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
