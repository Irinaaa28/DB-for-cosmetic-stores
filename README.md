# Data Base Project

This is an SQL project I created for managing a chain of cosmetic stores, developed by following these requirements:

1. **Description of the real model, its utility, and the operational rules.**  
2. **Presentation of the constraints (restrictions, rules) imposed on the model.**  
3. **Description of entities, including specifying the primary key.**  
4. **Description of relationships, including specifying their cardinality.**  
5. **Description of attributes, including data types, any constraints, default values, and possible attribute values.**  
6. **Creation of the entity-relationship diagram corresponding to the description from points 3-5.**  
7. **Creation of the conceptual diagram corresponding to the entity-relationship diagram designed in point 6.** The resulting conceptual diagram must contain at least 7 tables (excluding subentities), including at least one associative table.  
8. **Enumeration of the relational schemas corresponding to the conceptual diagram designed in point 7.**  
9. **Normalization up to the 3rd normal form (1NF-3NF).**  
    - **First Normal Form (1NF)**  
    - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**  
    - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**  
10. **Creation of a sequence to be used for inserting records into tables (point 11).**  
11. **Creation of tables in SQL and insertion of coherent data into each of them (at least 5 records in each non-associative table; at least 10 records in associative tables; a maximum of 30 records in each table).**  
12. **Formulate in natural language and implement 5 complex SQL queries that, in their entirety, will utilize the following elements:**  
    - **Exercise 1**  
    - **Exercise 2**  
    - **Exercise 3**  
    - **Exercise 4**  
    - **Exercise 5**  
13. **Implementation of 3 operations for updating and deleting data using subqueries.**  
    - **Exercise 1**  
    - **Exercise 2**  
    - **Exercise 3**  
14. **Creation of a complex view. Provide an example of a DML operation allowed on that view and an example of a DML operation not allowed.**  
    - **Allowed DML Operation**  
    - **Not Allowed DML Operation**  
15. **Formulate in natural language and implement in SQL: a query that uses the outer join operation on at least 4 tables, a query that uses the division operation, and a query that implements top-n analysis.**  
    - **Outer join**  
    - **Division**  
    - **Top-n analysis**  

The project contains three documents. The document "133_Coman_IrinaElena-proiect" includes all the requirements, the second one "133_Coman_IrinaElena-creare_inserare" covers requirements 10-11, and the third "133_Coman_IrinaElena-exemple" contains requirements 12-15.
